## üìö Levels Overview

The NetPractice exercises are organized into 10 levels of increasing difficulty:

- **Levels 1-3**: Basic IP addressing and simple networks
- **Levels 4-6**: Subnetting and network segmentation
- **Levels 7-8**: Routing between multiple networks
- **Levels 9-10**: Complex routing scenarios and advanced configurations

Each level presents a network topology where you must configure:
- IP addresses for network interfaces
- Subnet masks (CIDR notation)
- Routing tables
- Network connections

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Use

1. **Start the Application**: Open `net_practice/index.html` in your browser
2. **Enter Your Login** (optional): For 42 students, enter your intranet login
3. **Select a Level**: Choose from levels 1-10 or start with level 1
4. **Configure the Network**: 
   - Click on editable fields (highlighted in the interface)
   - Enter appropriate IP addresses, subnet masks, or routes
   - Follow CIDR notation for subnets (e.g., /24, /28)
5. **Validate**: Click "Check again" to verify your configuration
6. **Proceed**: Move to the next level once the current one is correctly configured

### Defense Mode

## üåê Networking Concepts

This section provides essential networking theory covered in NetPractice:

### TCP ‚Äî Transmission Control Protocol
TCP is a protocol that ensures reliable data transfer, guaranteeing that data arrives at its destination in the correct order.

### IP ‚Äî Internet Protocol
IP provides unique addresses that identify devices when connected to the internet. It's responsible for addressing and routing data packets across networks.

**IPv4 Structure**: A 32-bit number divided into 4 octets (8 bits each), with two main parts:
- **Network ID**: Identifies the network
- **Host ID**: Identifies the specific device on the network

![Network Structure](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1134d570-f2d9-46d7-8555-a09150ecd16e)

### Classful Addressing

IP addresses are organized into classes:

- **Class A** (first bit is 0): Range 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255
- **Class B** (first two bits are 10): Range 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255  
- **Class C** (first three bits are 110): Range 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
- **Class D** (first four bits are 1110): Range 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 (Multicast)
- **Class E** (first four bits are 1111): Range 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 (Reserved)

### Private Networks
Networks reserved for internal use within organizations or homes:
- **10.0.0.0/8**: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
- **172.16.0.0/12**: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
- **192.168.0.0/16**: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

### Loopback Addresses
Reserved for internal testing and communication within a device:
- **127.0.0.0/8**: 127.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255 (localhost)

### Network Devices

#### Switch
A device that connects multiple devices within a single network. Unlike routers, switches only distribute packets within their local network segment.

#### Router  
A device that connects two or more IP networks. Each network connection uses an interface (physical port or wireless connection).

### TCP/IP Model
The modern networking model used by all devices today, defining how data transfers from sender to receiver.

![TCP/IP Model](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb76698e-5fa3-4ba5-a8d0-ec048e055392)

This model uses 4 layers (compared to OSI's 7 layers):
1. **Network Access Layer**
2. **Internet Layer**  
3. **Transport Layer**
4. **Application Layer**

### Subnetting
The process of dividing a network into smaller sub-networks.

#### Subnet Attributes:
- **Network ID**: First IP address in the subnet
- **Broadcast IP**: Last IP address in the subnet
- **First Host IP**: First usable IP (Network ID + 1)
- **Last Host IP**: Last usable IP (Broadcast IP - 1)
- **Next Network**: Network ID of the next subnet
- **IP Address Count**: Number of IPs in subnet
- **CIDR/Subnet Mask**: Network size notation

**Formula**: Number of IP addresses = 2^(32-CIDR)

#### Subnetting Cheat Sheet

1. **Start with powers of 2**: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128
![Subnetting Step 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5b341f1-16ce-4a43-9706-f846ac357104)

2. **Subtract from 256**: 256-1=255, 256-2=254, etc.
![Subnetting Step 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fc45bef-8640-4454-8c41-95589aa96675)

3. **CIDR notation**: /32, /31, /30, etc.
![CIDR Notation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d7cab72-6999-4fc1-86c5-61874795684d)

4. **Complete reference table**:

### TCP Connection Process

#### 1. Connection Establishment (3-Way Handshake)
1. **SYN**: Client sends SYN with sequence number
2. **SYN-ACK**: Server responds with SYN-ACK and acknowledgment number  
3. **ACK**: Client sends final ACK to establish connection

#### 2. Data Transmission
- **Segmentation**: Data broken into smaller segments
- **Sequence Numbers**: Each segment gets a sequence number for proper ordering
- **Acknowledgments**: Receiver sends ACK for each segment
- **Flow Control**: "Sliding window" prevents overwhelming the receiver
- **Error Checking**: Checksums verify data integrity

**Example**:
- Connection established with ISN 1000
- Segment 1: "Hello" (5 bytes) - Sequence: 1000-1004
- Segment 2: "World" (5 bytes) - Sequence: 1005-1009

#### 3. Connection Termination (4-Way Handshake)
1. **FIN**: One side sends FIN (finish) signal
2. **ACK**: Other side acknowledges the FIN
3. **FIN**: Second side sends its own FIN
4. **ACK**: Original sender acknowledges, connection closed

### Communication Types

#### Data Distribution:
- **Unicast**: One-to-one communication (email)
- **Multicast**: One-to-many specific destinations (video streaming)
- **Broadcast**: One-to-all devices in network segment

#### Communication Modes:
- **Simplex**: One-way communication (radio broadcast)
- **Half-Duplex**: Two-way, but not simultaneous (walkie-talkie)
- **Full-Duplex**: Simultaneous two-way communication (phone call)
