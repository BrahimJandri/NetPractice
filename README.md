# What is an IP Address?
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main purposes:
Identification: It identifies a device on a network, allowing it to send and receive data.
Location Addressing: It provides information about the device's location within the network.
IP addresses come in two versions: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 addresses are written in a format called dotted-decimal notation, consisting of four octets (e.g., 192.168.1.1), while IPv6 addresses are longer and written in hexadecimal.
