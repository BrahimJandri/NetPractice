# NetPractice
Introduction This project is a general practical exercise to let you discover networking.

# TCP — Transmission Control Protocol
Is a protocol that ensures a reliable data transfer, it ensures that the data being transferred arrives and in the correct order.

# IP — Internet Protocol
Is a unique address that define the identity of the devices when is connected to the internet. It is responsible for addressing and routing data packets across the network.

There are two types of IP (Ipv4 & Ipv6), Ipv4 is a 32-bit number divided into 4 block (4 octet) each 8-bits.

The IP address has two main parts: the Host ID, and the Network ID.

Classful Addressing is a way of organizing and managing IP Addresses.

Class A (first bit is 0), range: 0000 0000 to 0111 1111
Class B (first two bits is 10), range: 1000 0000 to 1011 1111
Class C (first three bits is 110), range: 1100 0000 to 1101 1111
Class D (first four bits is 1110), range: 1110 0000 to 1110 1111
Class E (first three bits is 1111), range: 1111 0000 to 1111 1111

# Private Networks
They are Networks reserved for internal use with organization or home or small office network.
- 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
- 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
- 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

# Loop-back Addresses
They are addresses that are reserved for internal testing and communication within a device, like when using 127.0.0.1 ‘localhost’ for accessing the device itself.
- 127.0.0.0 — 127.255.255.255

# What is a Switch?
A switch is a device that connects multiple devices in a single network. Unlike router, the switch it only purpose is to distribute packets in its local network.

# What is a Router?
A router is a device that connects two or more IP Networks. Each network that a router connects to is linked through an interface, which can be a physical port or a wireless connection.

# What is TCP/IP Model?
This is the Model that all the devices uses today, it is a model that defines how data will be transferred from the sender to the receiver.

This Model is similar to the OSI Model which uses all the 7 layers that we talk about, but this Model only uses 4 layers.

# Subnetting
Subnetting is taking a network and dividing it into sub-network.

A Subnet have seven attributes:

Network ID — First IP Address in each Sub-Network
Broadcast IP — Last IP Address in each Sub-Network
First Host IP — IP Address after the Network ID
Last Host IP — IP Address before the Broadcast IP
Next Network — Network ID of the next Sub-Network
#IP Addresses — Number of IP Addresses in Sub-Network
CIDR/Subnet — Size of the Network

The number of IP Address are calculated using ( 2^(32-CIDR) )

How to Draw a Cheat sheet for the sub masks

1- Start with 1, double until you reach 128

2. Subtract top row from 256

4. From /32, list CIDR notation

Then we have our table

Now lets have an example and calculate for this network 10.1.1.37/29

Tips to get the Network ID, Broadcast, and the other information:

1- Land on one of the group size and increment by the size of the IP Address.

2. Land on the sub-net value of the same column.

4. Start higher and subtract.

# TCP connection walk-through

# 1 - Connection Establishment
To initiate a connection between two devices A and B, A set up a sequence number first, then he sends a SYN signal, then B will send a ACK signal back with the Acknowledgment number and the SYN with the sequence number, then A will send an ACK with the acknowledgement number and the sequence number + 1 (sequence number are random generated by the sender). Then the connection is Established.
When the connection is Established both the A and B can send data to each other.
# 2 - Data Transmission
Segment Data: The application data is broken into smaller chunks called segments. Each segment is encapsulated into a TCP Packet.
Sequence Number: Each TCP segment is assigned a sequence number that helps in reordering the segments correctly at the receiving end.
- example, Suppose a connection is established with an ISN of 1000. Segment 1: Data: “Hello” (5 bytes) | Sequence Number: 1000 (the sequence number of the first byte, “H”) | Bytes in this segment: 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004 | Segment 2: Data: “World” (5 bytes) | Sequence Number: 1005 (the next byte after “Hello”) | Bytes in this segment: 1005, 1006, 1007, 1008, 1009.
Acknowledgments — The receiver sends back an ACK for each segment received. If an ACK is not received, the sender may re-transmit the segment.
Flow Control — TCP uses a flow control mechanism called the “sliding window” to ensure that the sender does not overwhelm the receiver with too much data at once.
Error Checking — Each TCP segment has a checksum to verify the integrity of the data. If the checksum doesn’t match, the segment is discarded, and the sender is asked to re-transmit.
# 3 - Connection Termination
Step 1: FIN — One side (usually the client) sends a TCP packet with the FIN (finish) flag set, indicating that it has finished sending data.
Step 2: ACK — FIN— The other side acknowledges the FIN by sending an ACK, and FIN packet to indicate that it is also done sending data.
Step 3: ACK — The original sender of the FIN acknowledges the second FIN with an ACK, and the connection is closed.

Terms related to data transmission and communication:

Uni-cast: communication method where data is sent from one single source to one single destination (Send an email).
Multicast: communication method where data is sent from one source to multiple specific destinations, but not to all nodes in the network (Video streaming or Online gaming).
Broadcast: communication method where data sent from one source to all nodes within the network segment.

# Mode of communication

Type of Duplex:

1 - Simplex: one-way communication (like Radio).
2 - Half-Duplex: two-way communication but not simultaneously (like walkies-talkie).
3 - Full-Duplex: two-way communication that occurs simultaneously (like Phone calls).
