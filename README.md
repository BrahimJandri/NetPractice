# NetPractice
Introduction This project is a general practical exercise to let you discover networking.


# What is an IP Address?
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main purposes:
Identification: It identifies a device on a network, allowing it to send and receive data.
Location Addressing: It provides information about the device's location within the network.
IP addresses come in two versions: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 addresses are written in a format called dotted-decimal notation, consisting of four octets (e.g., 192.168.1.1), while IPv6 addresses are longer and written in hexadecimal.

# What is a Subnet Mask?
A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that divides an IP address into two parts: the network part and the host part. It helps determine which portion of the IP address refers to the network and which part refers to the specific device (host) within that network.
The subnet mask is also expressed in dotted-decimal format, similar to an IP address (e.g., 255.255.255.0). Each octet in the subnet mask can be either 255 (indicating that the corresponding bits in the IP address are part of the network) or 0 (indicating that the bits are part of the host).
